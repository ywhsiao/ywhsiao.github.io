I am a first-year Biostatistics PhD student at National Taiwan University, supported by Taiwanese excellent doctor scholarship.

I had worked in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics core lab
as a research assistant/Bioinformatician in the Center of Genomic and Precision Medicine at NTU from March 2016 to July 2019, dealing with various kinds of Next-generation Sequencing data, such as RNA-seq, ChiP-seq, whole-exome sequencing and 16s amplicon sequencing, for further biological interpretation.

Before joining NTU, I finished my second M.S. in Biotechnology at Newcastle University, supervised under Dr James Stach. I also hold my first M.S. and a B.S. in Chemical Engineering at National Chung Cheng University.
