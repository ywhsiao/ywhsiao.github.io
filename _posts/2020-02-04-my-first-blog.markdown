This is my first time to build my personal blog. I usually take notes about what I have learnt into e-notebooks. It's a kind of learning hobbies to record and trace back the interesting idea. So, the aim of this blog is not only for sharing the information but also for future career application.


#### Contents that I'd like to share in my blog:
<ul>
    <li>Genomics</li>
    <li>Technical skills (such R or Python)</li>
    <li>Statistics</li>
    <li>ML & DL</li>
</ul>
